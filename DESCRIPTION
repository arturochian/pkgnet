Description: Package DESCRIPTION files allows for specifying several types of
	inter-package relations.  These include fields like Depends, Suggests,
	Enhances etc. This package allows for recovering graph structure based
	on these relations. Network representation of R repositories enables
	the user to fruitfully explore the interconnected space of available R
	functionality while the developers or repository maintainers can
	quickly scan package forward and reverse dependencies.
